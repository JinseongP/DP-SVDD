# Differentially-private-multi-class-classification-using-kernel-supports-and-equilibrium-points
Python implementation for 'Differentially private multi-class classification using kernel supports and equilibrium points'

### How to use

1. Run SVDD_DP.py file for default settings
   : You can change parameters in main function such as C (for SVDD), gamma (for RBF kernel), lr (for gradients when finding EPs), n_iter (for gradients when finding EPs), round_sep (for hypercube), averaged (for averaging n runs).
2. Specific Python implementataions for Multi-Basin Support-Based Clustering are in SVC.py.


### Requirement

scipy
sklearn
numpy
cvxopt
